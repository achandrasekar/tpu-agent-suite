"""Template for the per-iteration profile run (never executed as-is).

`assemble_profile_run.py` copies this file byte-for-byte, substitutes the three
constants below, then appends the run's `get_inputs()` source and an exec-bound
`opt_computation` -- the same shape as `test_harness_template.py`, and for the
same reason: the parts an LLM authors stay small and the parts that must be
exact are copied by a tool.

Two things in here are load-bearing and easy to get wrong by hand:

  * `LIBTPU_INIT_ARGS` is set BEFORE `import jax`. libtpu reads it once, at
    initialization. Set it afterwards and the trace still captures, still looks
    complete, and simply has no LLO data in it -- which XProf reports as
    `status: UNAVAILABLE` / `reason: LLO_DATA_ABSENT`, i.e. a Pallas kernel
    shows up as one opaque block with no kernel-level detail. That is the whole
    reason tpu-kernel-development profiles at all.
  * Warm-up runs happen OUTSIDE `start_trace`. The first call compiles, so a
    trace that includes it attributes compilation time to the kernel.

`get_inputs`, `opt_computation` and `main` reference each other across the
append boundary, so `# noqa: F821` marks the names this file cannot see.
