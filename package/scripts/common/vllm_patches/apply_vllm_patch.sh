# Apply a vllm_torchtpu patch to the plugin installed on the target, in the
# container that is about to use it. The task image is never rebuilt, so every
# job that imports the plugin applies the patch again; this is idempotent.
#
#   bash apply_vllm_patch.sh <patch> [<plugin source root>]
#
# The source root is the directory holding `vllm_torchtpu/`. Without one, it is
# found by importing the plugin with $TPU_AGENT_SUITE_PYTHON (else python3), so an
# editable checkout and a site-packages install are patched alike.
#
# A patch is one of two kinds, told apart by its extension:
#
# - `.patch`, a fixed unified diff. Already applied is detected by the patch
#   itself reversing cleanly, not by a marker string, so an image that ships an
#   upstream fix with different code is reported as drift rather than silently
#   skipped or double-patched. It applies to the revision it was cut from only.
# - `.py`, a patch script, run with the same Python as `<script> <source root>`.
#   It finds its own anchors, so it can follow the plugin across revisions; it
#   must decide every change before writing any, keep these exit codes, and
#   print the same `vllm patch applied` / `already applied` line.
#
# Exit codes: 0 applied or already applied; 2 usage; 3 plugin not found;
# 4 the patch does not apply to this plugin revision.
