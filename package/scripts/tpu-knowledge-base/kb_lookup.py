"""Provide relevant context for a task to be completed.

Look each key up in the catalog. A key matches a folder, a page on disk, a
page built earlier from a source, or a source that has not been built yet --
and the last two are the same thing at different ages. Keys that match
contribute their pages and references to one result; if none match, the
answer is a single prompt over all of them, and says it is grounded in
nothing.

A url the harness CLI could not summarise is downloaded to a local file and
comes back as a `to_read` item: the tpu-knowledge-base subagent summarises that
file with the instructions given, and keeps the summary with

    kb_lookup.py --keep ENTRY KEYWORD FILE [--run RUN_ID]

With `--no-crawl` (the request's `allow_crawl: false`) nothing is read now:
only pages on disk and current kept pages are served, and a url with
neither is cited in `not_read`.
